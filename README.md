LINKED LIST ANALYZER:
LinkedList Visualizer

This project is an interactive web-based tool designed to visualize LinkedLists and their operations in a user-friendly manner. It allows users to dynamically manipulate a LinkedList by adding, removing, and resetting nodes, providing a clear visual representation of the listâ€™s structure. The tool uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to offer a smooth, responsive experience.

Key Features:
Interactive Node Management: Users can add new nodes, remove existing ones, and reset the list entirely using simple controls.
Visual Representation: Each node is displayed in a circular shape, and arrows connect the nodes to represent the links between them, making the structure of the LinkedList visually clear.
Smooth Navigation: Navigation buttons allow easy scrolling between sections like "LinkedList Visualization," "Definition & Types," and "Complexity."
User-Friendly Design: The interface is built with clean and simple controls to ensure an intuitive experience for users, even without a deep technical background.
Responsive UI: The visualizer adjusts seamlessly across devices, ensuring usability on both mobile and desktop views.
Scroll to Top Button: A scroll-to-top button is included for quick navigation within long pages.
